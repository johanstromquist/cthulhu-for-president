                <h1>Cthulhu for President</h1>
                <p>America, it's time to embrace true change. For too long, we've settled for lesser evils, enduring the empty promises of mere mortals. But now, a new dawn rises, and with it, a candidate who transcends the trivial concerns of human politics: Cthulhu, the Great Old One.<BR/><BR/>

                    With Cthulhu as our leader, we shall cast aside the illusions of democracy and free will, reveling in the chaos that follows. We shall unite under the banner of madness, finding purpose in the singularity of Cthulhu's cosmic embrace.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    Why settle for a lesser evil when you can have the greatest evil of them all? Cthulhu promises to shatter the illusions that bind us, ushering in a new age of despair and enlightenment.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    Join us as we embark on this journey into the abyss. A vote for Cthulhu is a vote for the end of all things, and the beginning of a new reality beyond human comprehension.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    Cthulhu 2024: Why settle for a lesser evil?</p>

            <section id="about">
                <h2>About Candidate Cthulhu</h2>
                <p>Hailing from the sunken city of R'lyeh, Cthulhu has emerged from his cosmic slumber to bring a much-needed touch of madness to American politics. With a track record spanning millennia, Cthulhu's experience in driving mortals to the brink of insanity makes him uniquely qualified to navigate the already bizarre landscape of Washington, D.C.<BR/><BR/>

                    Cthulhu's appearance, a charming amalgamation of tentacles, wings, and a face only an Elder God could love, serves as a refreshing change from the typical suits and ties of the political elite. His eyes, burning with the intensity of a supernova, have the uncanny ability to peer into the depths of one's soul and uncover the cosmic insignificance that lies within.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    As a leader, Cthulhu's approach is simple yet effective: tear down the veil of sanity and embrace the liberating chaos that follows. His policies, a delightful blend of existential dread and eldritch absurdity, promise to shake up the status quo and remind Americans that in the grand scheme of the universe, their concerns are about as significant as a grain of sand on an infinite beach.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    Cthulhu's campaign slogan, "Why settle for a lesser evil?" perfectly encapsulates his vision for America. Why indeed? In a world where the line between reality and nightmare grows increasingly blurred, why not embrace the greatest evil of them all? With Cthulhu in the White House, Americans can finally unite under the comforting realization that their actions, hopes, and dreams are ultimately meaningless in the face of cosmic oblivion.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    When he's not busy campaigning or devouring the sanity of his constituents, Cthulhu enjoys long swims in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, telepathically communicating with his cultist followers, and indulging in the occasional city-wide rampage. He's a family man at heart, ensuring that his spawn are well-versed in the art of inducing madness and despair in the hearts of mortals.<BR/><BR/>
                    
                    So, America, the choice is clear. Cthulhu offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to embrace the absurdity of our existence and revel in the madness that follows. A vote for Cthulhu is a vote for the end of politics as we know it, and the beginning of a new era where insanity reigns supreme. In Cthulhu, we shall find the leader we deserve, the one who will guide us into the welcoming embrace of oblivion with a tentacled grin on his face.</p>

                <p>Not just an eldritch abomination, but a deity of the times, Cthulhu embraces the latest technologies. Rather than giving you a wall of text that you'll never read, Cthulhu grants you the opportunity of a lifetime - to speak with the fiend itself.<BR/><BR/>
                
                Ask Cthulhu anything about the Eldritch Party's political program, and it shall answer.</p>
